# Introduction
This is a modified version of the openDTU project. The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU).
All credit goes to the original authors. The modifications are no-brainers and are only meant to use the core of openDTU with a ESP8266 module.

Most functionality has been stripped away, only the bare minimum is left to get the ESP8266 to work with the DTU module.

# Usage
Check the privates_template.h file and fill in the required information. Rename the file to privates.h and upload the sketch to the ESP8266.

# License
The original project is licensed under the GNU GPL v2.0 license. This project is licensed under the same license.
